# go-virtualbox

**This fork simplifies the machine.Modify() command that is failing on Linux for an unknown reason. I'm using this as testing, won't fix the problem**

This is a wrapper package for Golang to interact with VirtualBox. The API is
experimental at the moment and you should expect frequent changes.
